        <p>The organization of this page represents Visual Hierarchy. The focus of the page
          falls onto a large image representing the main message of the website. There are two smaller
          images adjacent to the large one, but when viewed on a smaller
          device, the smaller images and links fall into place of importance for the viewers,
          while the central images are still the primary focus of the page.

        <p>
          The elements on the Amazon website are all in close proximity to one another.
          For this website, it is a selling tactic. All of the blocks together let the users
          view multiple products immediately when the site loads. This creates connections and
          a direct relationship between the elements.

        <img src="images/typing.jpg" alt="Typing.com">
        <p>
          The home page for Typing.com has lots of space between each of the 
          elements of the page, thus creating an open site. Each element is clear to the 
          user and enhances their accessibility and experience of the website.
